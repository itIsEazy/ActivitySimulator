When u see TryToPlay, TryToClick, TryToAccept etc ...
method with Try in the beginning it means it has try - catch in it
AND
if it succeeded it continues
if NOT it must 'log' error in future class Errors or something



Automated searches

STEPS : 

List<string> searchInputs

foreach searchInput in searchInputs

	SearcFor(searchInput)
		
		


HARDPART : 
Problem :
We have list of offers we need to check! BUT foreach offer we have to open it and see its description to be 100% sure
there is not something in our 'key words' we miss

eZ solution: 
open $"https://www.olx.bg/ads/q-{searchInput}/" every 10 minutes ? 15 mins ...
and check every offer .. ez as it is

The problem there is we will wait 10 mins ... and for 10 min we can miss all the good offers
(yes most of the best offers i found on olx, bazar etc vanished in less then 10min.. sometimes 5mins is a lot ...)


HARD solution:

every 1 min? 5 min idk maybe r.Next(1,5 * 60 * 1000)
refresh / call $"https://www.olx.bg/ads/q-{searchInput}/"

get last 10 / 20 offers (1st page only is more than enough if u refresh every 5 - 10 minutes)


compare currLast10 with last10 offers

foreach currOffer in currLast10

	if last10.Contains(currOffer) // or .Name == .Name ...
		
		List<Offer> offersToCheckForKeyWords = currLast10[0] to currOffer[i] //
		aka check all the offers until u find offer in your previous listed offer
		WARNIGN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		will be great if u add foreach for ALL the offers from this day and REcheck them
		/this must be done in case somebody adds or changes something in their offer, so u can catch it/
